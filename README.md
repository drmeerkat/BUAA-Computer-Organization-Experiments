# BUAA-Computer-Organization-Experiments
### 0x00 Introduction
This is a repo including all the Verilog codes for BUAA B3I062410 Computer Organization experiments. 
P6 is a 5-stage pipline processor supporting up to **50** different mips instructions with high scalability.
### 0x01 Features
- Support up to 50 different misp instructions
- Self designed data paths and forward mechanism
- High scalability (You may add your own instruction or new mips insturction support based on current design quickly)
  - Worth to mention that our test is in the form of online test requiring us to add support to 3 teacher assigned new mips instructions in less than 2 hours.
### 0x02 File Structure
In every directory, 'code.txt' contains the Verilog code for that experiment. And for more specific infomation/lab instructions, please refer to '.docx' or '.pdf' in the corresponding directory.
- P3
  - Simplified version of single cycle mips cpu
- P4
  - Support more instructions based on P3.
- P5
  - Simplified version of 5-stage pipline processor.
  - Designed basic data paths and forward mechanism.
- P6 (Final Version)
  - Add support to more than 50 MIPS instructions.
  - Support mult/div calculation and more advanced forward mechanism.
 
### 0x03 Some thoughts
- Start earlier !
- Make your own plan
- Don't panic. Roman was not built in a day. (I always reflect on this quote)
